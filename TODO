Bugs:
- When parsing a file which depends of genom, we need the genom extension, it's
  a bit boring

Optimization:

Improvements:

- Add a way to describe enum, or in a more general way Non recursive sum type
- Don't encode the precedence in the grammar, but use the shunting-yard algorithm
  on the flat ast tree.
- Allow parametrization of tasks. 
  Something like that
		task go_to {
			depends Pts
			pre = {}
			post = { localisation::distance(pos::current, Pts)  < 2.0 }
		}

  instead of enforcing that it pass by pos::goal and an unification on pos::goal.
  It would be easier to write constraint (no more where clause), but a bit more hard to select
  the right task (a first step could be to evaluate go_to(x) for all x known in
  the context, but it may have some better strategies). Moreover, to do that, we must deal correctly 
  with multiples instanciation of the same task (which is not possible for the moment).

- Allow to access member of a structure using .

- Add some end handler of the same kind than body. Will change the state of the
  agent at the end of the recipe, even if it is interrupted.

- Implement maintain 

- Fix the terminaison value of remote_values<>.async_get. Don't return the last error_code, but
  search in the whole computation if some errors occurs, and return this particular error_code.
  Add an error_code to denote that the request finish, but that we do not get some value

- Correct CMakeLists to search correctly the dependencies

- Write some user documentation + man pages

- Improve error management at the compiler level
