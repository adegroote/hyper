The Hyper project is an implementation of a supervision framework. It is a
2-clause BSD-licensed project (cf LICENSE).

The current stuff is not a working software, it does not do anything really
useful nowadays.

Installation
------------

You need a recent Boost-version to build hyper (boost >= 1.44) and cmake.
It has been tested on
	- ubuntu x86-64 (gcc 4.5.1, gcc 4.4.3, clang-current)
	- NetBSD x86-64 (gcc 4.1.3, you need a special patch for boost, ticket 4662)
	- Windows 7 x86-64 ( visual studio 2010, boost 1.44)

To build it :
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${PREFIX} .
  make 
  make install
  make test (to play the regression test)

Warning :
  some files take really long time to compile (in particular
  src/compiler/parser.cc, src/compiler/task_parser.cc,
  src/compiler/expression.cc), and take an huge amount of memory. 

Network related test can take long time to execute, due to some code testing
timeout.

Documentation
-------------

TODO :D
The code is not usable in any useful way, the documentation will come with the
0.1 release
