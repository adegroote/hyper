The Hyper project is an implementation of a supervision framework. It is a
2-clause BSD-licensed project (cf LICENSE).

Installation
------------

You need a recent Boost-version to build hyper (boost >= 1.46.1) and cmake. if
you want to build doc too, you need also sphinx and gzip

To build it :
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${PREFIX} .
  make 
  make install
  make test (to play the regression test)

If you want to build the doc, you need to pass to cmake the flag
-DBUILD_DOC=ON.

Warning :
  some files take really long time to compile (in particular
  src/compiler/parser.cc, src/compiler/task_parser.cc,
  src/compiler/expression.cc), and take an huge amount of memory. 

Network related test can take long time to execute, due to some code testing
timeout.

Status
------

Hyper is used on a daily basis to control LAAS UGV, with more than 20 agents.
The programming language associated can be considered as relatively stable.
Unit-test should all pass. 

Documentation
-------------

Even if the code is pretty stable, the documentation is well inexistent at the moment. 
It must be done before first stable version.
